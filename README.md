# Cargo Value Plugin

Displays the total value of items stored in a sailing cargo hold directly in the cargo interface.

This plugin calculates the **Grand Exchange (GE)** and **High Alchemy (HA)** value of the currently open cargo hold and appends it to the cargo UI, similar in spirit to RuneLite’s Bank Value feature.

## 📦 Features

### Cargo Hold Total Value
When a sailing cargo hold interface is opened, the plugin displays:
- **Total GE value**
- **Total HA value**

The values are appended to the cargo interface text so you can quickly see what your cargo is worth.

### Configurable Display
The plugin supports several display options:
- Toggle **GE value**
- Toggle **HA value**
- Show **exact numbers** which expands out the full price (i.e. 1.2M -> 1,2xx,xxx)
